# shapeIdle
shapeIdle is an idle game mainly focused on the basic geometric figures, with incrementing sides as the game progresses.

# Features
Main features of the game include:
- Click the current shape to start earning.
- When enough money (currency still TBD) is available, you can upgrade to the next shape (+1 side)
- When the shape has enough sides, the player can decide to rebirth to start over with an added bonus.
- And much more to come...

# Development
The game is still under heavy development, so no releases are currently available. We aim to bring the game to the Android mobile platform via a downloadable APK or via Google Play Store.
The game will also be available in our GitHub Pages website as soon as a first release is made.

The team working on the game consists of three members:
-   [PhysicTargaryen](https://github.com/PhysicTargaryen) - Lead game designer, UI design
-   [Roix87](https://github.com/Roix87) - UI design, sound expert
